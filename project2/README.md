//Programming Languages Project 2//
//Funcitonal Programming//
//Simulated Binary Logic and Arithmetic Operations of CPU Written in F#//

A project to learn functional programming, using F#.

The program simulates binary arithmetic and logic by converting ints and hex values to signed 8 bit binary values. These are represented in a binary list of length 8, with list[0] denoting the sign of the value.

To compile:
fsharpc project2.fs -o output.exe

To run:
mono output.exe

(assuming you have the right dependencies)

Example output is shown in text files and screenshots included.
